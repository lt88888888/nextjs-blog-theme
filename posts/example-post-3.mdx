## How AI coding works?

To create detailed instructions we use AI to write us detailed project development documentation.
This step is very important and can't be skipped if you want to build production-ready application.

## 1. Write detailed Project Documentation about your application.

> Documents include:
>
> > PRD/ App Flow Doc/ Tech STack Doc/ Frontent Guidelines/ Backend Structure Doc
> > and any other docs you might find useful.

## 2. AI Chat

> You'll notice 2 features with same layout: AI Chat/ Composer
>
> > AI chat gives you more control. It won't implement anything autonomously
> > Use AI chat to understand code, errors and ask for step by step fixes

## 3.Cursor AI Composer

> This is the main feature of Cursor. This is where Cursor uses AI to write code and implement code.
>
> > It has 2 options:normal/ agent
> > Normal composer is the old composer where terminal is not integrated in chat. With agent update now it can reason, implement, iterate and fix errors.
> > Agent is getting better and better and that's what most AI devs use on daily basis.

## 4.Rules For AI

> Go to Settings → General → Rules For AI
>
> > You need to add a Role for AI + tech stack + guidelines + limitations. These boundaries will enhance the code quality and you'll get less errors.
> > Notre: Rules for AI and .cursorrules file are 2 different files.

## 5. cursorrules file

> Rules for AI is like a personality of our your AI coding model. And .cursorrules file is project specific instructions. It's like a map of your project.
> You need to add:
>
> > *   what file structure you want?
> > *   which file will go in which folder?
> > *   project specific guidelines and instructions.
> >     CodeGuide can also write .cursorrules file.

## 6.Docs:

> This is where you can attach web links of any official docs you might be using in the project like API Docs, NextJS docs, Shadcn Docs. (this doesn't work all the time but still beneficial)
> For anyone building with Next.js, deploying on Netlify means you get the best of **speed, reliability, and ease**—all the ingredients needed to create high-performing, user-friendly web apps!
