And I found that Cursor is the best AI Coding IDE for complex applications like:
- Web applications
- Mobile Applications
- Downloadable Software
So If you master Cursor, you can code anything!


##  Ideation/Inspiration

Start with mapping out your idea. This is a very important step. 

You need to visualize the screens, features, layout in your head.

You can draw on paper or go to dribbble or behance for UI design inspirations.

## Documentation

You already know, AI coding is done by AI models like Claude Sonnet 3.5 or GPT4o. 

These models require detailed context about the project you want to develop. 
![Documentation](/public/images/docm.jpg "Image corsur")
For this purpose we need to write "Project Development Documentation"
> ### Cursorrules file & Rules for AI
> > Cursor scans Rules for AI and .cursorrules file the first so we need to fill up these first. 
> > Rules for AI: This is general settings about your coding workflow. (for every project this can stay the same if you use same tach stack)
> > .cursorrules file: This is project specific instructions file. Take inspirations from cursor .directory site.

> ### Project Requirements Document (PRD)
> > This is the most important document for for AI coding project.
> > This doc provides the summary of all aspects of the project like:
> > *  Introduction
> > *  App flow
> > *  Core features
> > *  Tech Stack
> > * In scope vs out of scope
> > Basically its your project map that you can provide to AI coding models
![Project Requirements](/public/images/proj.jpg "Image corsur")

> ### App Flow Document
> > This Document should provide end to end rundown to AI model.
> > "User start its journey from landing page then clicks on sign up button and sign up with Google and then land on dashboard. Dashboard has............ sections."
> > This will help AI model to map out connection between pages and process all features and limitations.
![App Flow Document](/public/images/appf.jpg "Image corsur")

> ### Tech Stack Document
> > This document should provide all technical details about the project like:
> > * Frontend Tech Stack
> > * Backend Tech Stack
> > * API iIntegrations
> > * Deployment Instructions
> > This doc will enable AI model to understand what packages and dependencies to install.

![Tech Stack Document](/public/images/teck.jpg "Image corsur")

> ### Frontend Guidelines

> > This Document should provide all details about how you want your project to look like - visually:
> >  Deisgn Principles/ Styling Instructions/ Page Layout
> >  Navigation/ Color Pallates/ Fonts
> > This is a skin of of your project. The better it is explained the prettier your app will look.
![Frontend Guidelines](/public/images/front.jpg "Image corsur")

> ### Backend Structure

> > This Document will explain to AI model about:
> >  Backend Tech/ User Authentication/ Database Architecture
> >  Storage buckets/ API Endpoints/ Security measures/ Hosting Solutions
> > This is the main brain of your project. Your app will fetch and display data from your backend.
![Backend Structure](/public/images/back.jpg "Image corsur")

> ### Project Status Document

> > This is my own hack. This doc functions as a work log for AI model. 
> > It should record what steps it already completed, what step it is working on, what's left. 
> > This will help you open up your project anytime and AI will pick up from where it left.
> > I ask AI to update this document after every major feature completion. 
> > You just need to add this as an instruction in your .cursorrules file.
> > I also record errors, (how AI resolved that error? record that so I can reference it for future use for similar errors)

## Tips and Tricks:

1. Use o1 pro model to get your Documentation done. It is expensive but the quality of docs is amazing
  But you don't need to pay $200/moth just for this.

2. Build step by step. 
  If you ask AI to build a complete application in 1 prompt. That's not possible and it will mess up the project. 
So start page by page, section py section. 

3. There will be errors (Instruct better to resolve them)
  I copy and paste the error in composer and say "use chain of thought reasoning to find the core cause" 

4. Use *Agent in the composer. 
  This is the new update which enabled Cursor to use terminal within the composer so it can install packages itself. 

5. Use latest Sonnet 3.5 model (by default it Cursor runs on old Sonnet)

  You can enable that by going to settings then models and select Sonnet model on top.
I hope This Guide Helped you understand the AI Coding Workflow.
Project Development Documentation is very important and it's the 70% work in AI code. 
Rest is just making sure AI follows the instructions properly.
Use CodeGuide to save 7+ hours on Docs and 4.5M tokens/project.
